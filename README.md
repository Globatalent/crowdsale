# crowdsale

Ethereum contracts for the globatalent crowdsale platform.

## Technical definition
ERC20-compliant token, derived from the [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime) that allows for token cloning (forking).

## Contracts
### Utilities
#### [Controlled.sol](/contracts/Controlled.sol)
This contract provides useful methods to establish the address that can call functions of another contract.

<img src="https://github.com/Globatalent/crowdsale/blob/master/img/UML/Controlled.png">

- `onlyController()` [L6]: Checks that the address calling the function equals the controller address.
- `controller` [L8]: Controller address.
- `Controlled()` [L10]: Contract constructor. Sets controller variable to the address that creates the contract.
- `changeController(newController)` [L14-L16]: The actual controller can call this function to change controller to newController.

### Token specific:

#### [ERC20Token.sol](/contracts/ERC20Token.sol)
Interface for ERC20 compatible tokens.

<img src="https://github.com/Globatalent/crowdsale/blob/master/img/UML/ERC20Token.png">

- `totalSupply` [L16]: Variable that contains the total supply of the token.

#### [MiniMeToken.sol](/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol)
Inherits from: Controlled.

MiniMe token follows the ERC20 standard and implements all the functions described on ERC20Token.sol but since more logic is required by this token it breaks ERC20 functions into more than one method.

See [MINIME_README.md](/MINIME_README.md) for more information.

**[ERC20 methods]**

- `doTransfer` [L167]: Actual transfer function in this contract. Inside it balances are checked, the TokenController is warned that a transfer has been done and it checks that transfers are enabled.
- `balanceOfAt(owner, blockNumber)` [L309]: Returns the amount of tokens of owner at `blockNumber`.
- `totalSupply(blockNumber)` [L309]: Returns the total supply of tokens at `blockNumber`.
- `createCloneToken(cloneTokenName, cloneDecimalUnits,
cloneTokenSymbol, snapshotBlock, transfersEnabled)` [L344-366]: Creates a new clone token with the initial distribution being this token at `snapshotBlock`.
- `generateTokens(owner, amount)` [L376-386]: `amount` number of tokens are asigned to `owner`. This method can only be called from the controller of the token.
- `destroyTokens(owner, amount)` [L393-403]: Burns `amount` tokens from `owner`.
- `enableTransfers(transfersEnabled)` [L412-414]: Sets transfers enabled.
- `getValueAt(checkpoints, block)` [L424-445]: Returns the number of tokens at a given number block.
- `updateValueAtNow(checkpoints, value)` [L451-461]: Updates the history of balances.
- `isContract(addr)` [L467-474]: Internal function to determine if `addr` is a contract.
min(a, b) [L477-479]: Determine the minimum between two uints.
- `Default function` [L484-487]: The fallback function: If the contract's controller has not been set to 0, then the `proxyPayment` method is called which relays the ether and creates tokens as described in the token controller contract.
- `claimToken(token)` [L497-507]: This method can be used by the controller to extract mistakenly sent tokens to this contract.
- `Events` [L512-521]: Events used by the contract to emit values.
- `MiniMeTokenFactory` [L531-563]: This contract is used to generate clone contracts from a contract.

#### [Token.sol](/contracts/Token.sol)
Inherits from: MiniMeToken.
This creates an instance of MiniMeToken with the desired parameters to customize the token.

Inherits from: Owned, TokenController.
This is the contract where the contribution takes place. The first part of the contract declares the variables where the address of the holders will be stored, token, sets the sale limit and the max supply of the token.

On L11 SafeMath is specified for the type uint256, this guarantees that all the operations done with uint256 are not in danger of an overflow.
- `initialized()` [L40-43]: Modifier to check if the token contribution is initialized.
- `TokenContribution()` [L45-46]: Contract constructor.
- `changeController(newController)` [L51-54]: The owner can call this method to set the new controller of the contract.
- `initialize(token, destTokensReserve, destTokensTeam, desTokensBounties, destTokensAirdrop, destTokensAdvisors, destTokensEarlyInvestors)` [L59-93]: The owner of the contract can call this function to initialize the token contribution.

**[TokenController methods]**
- `generate(th, amount)` [L118-126]: The owner of the contract can call this method to generate `amount` tokens to `th` address.
- `finalize()` [L150-226]: The owner of the contract can call this method to finalize the contribution. After this method is called the correspondent tokens are sent to their holders.
- `percent(p)` [L228-230]: Does the percent of a number.
- `isContract(addr)` [L235-242]: Checks if `addr` is a contract.
- `tokensIssued()` [L250-252]: Returns total tokens issued.
- `getBlockNumber()` [L260-262]: Returns the block number.
- `getTime()` [L265-267]: Returns current time.
- `claimTokens(token)` [L278-291]: This method can be used by the controller to extract mistakenly sent tokens to this contract.
- `Events` [L293-299]: Events used by the contract to emit values.

### TokenHolders
All token holders follow the same structure, the only difference is the timing of the collectTokens function:

Inherits from: [Owned.sol](/contracts/Owned.sol)
Uses SafeMath for uint256 operations.

- `collectedTokens`: Amount of tokens collected from the holder.
- `crowdsale`: Address of the token contribution used to check the finalized time.
- `Minimetoken`: Address of the token to do the transfers.
- `Holder constructor (owner, crowdsale, minimetoken)`: Constructor of the contract.
- `collectTokens()`: The owner of the contract can call this function to collect tokens. If no tokens are available to collect at the time of call an exception is thrown. The locking period of the tokens differs from the holder. If there are tokens to collect, the amount is transferred to the owner account.
- `months(m)`: Returns m amount of months. This is used inside collectTokens to check if the locking period is over.
- `getTime()`: Returns current time.
- `claimTokens(token)`: This method can be used by the controller to extract mistakenly sent tokens to this contract.
- `Events`: Events used by the contract to emit values.
